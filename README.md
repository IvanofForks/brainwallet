Brain Wallet Calculator
========================

This offline java application enables you to create an Armory offline wallet from a custom secret you supply.

Combine the power of Armorys deterministic address generation with a brain wallet.

Besides creating a valid Armory wallet it creates a bitcoin private key and public address from the secret. This is of course not so sophisticated as the armory wallet generation as it results in exactly 1 bitcoin address per secret. Using the Armory wallet generation results in an unlimited number of addresses per secret because of Armorys awesome deterministic private key generation feature.

Attention: Use a strong secret with dozens of characters! Otherwise theft is very likely.
